SOCD2020 - Classic - Planning

It's Still Classic, so no daily quests actually available.
Best we get is repeatables... However the API system has changed ALOT

Don't need to scan tooltips anymore C_QuestLog.GetQuestInfo() takes Quest ID's and returns quest names localized.
GetAvailableQuestInfo() & GetGossipOptions() have different return values (7 now instead of 3, a lot of API is like this now)

Dont scan tips anymore! use the API
All Quests Will be disabled by default! (again, i don't want to be touching this thing every single patch!)
Dynamically generate options as quests are discovered
 -Only Really have options for quests that are enabled or have selection of rewards & create dynamically.
 -Means we need a UI window, likely created by hand with a check box and ?DropDown... 
	(-Can i cheat and use AceGUI or AceOptions?)
